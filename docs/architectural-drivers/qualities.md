# Zero-downtime

- the system has to minimize downtimes, especially before christmas, black fridays etc.

# high load

- the sytem will have to withstand high traffic seasonally

# autoscalability

- since the traffic varies through year, the system will have to autoacommodate more resources in high traffic seasons, but can use less resources when less traffic is needed
